# Contents and commentary
The repository contains requested supporting documentation for my PhD application. These are:

## 1. Thesis
As part of our course, there was no Master thesis. Instead, we completed a Final Year Design project, 
a group project aimed at comprehensive process design. To provide a sample of my individual work,
I also attached my Bachelor thesis, which I wrote during my year at RWTH Aachen. As I received the
highest grade 1.0 for this work, I also added the evaluation script :)

## 2. References
Unfortunately, I have not been able to get a reference from RWTH Aachen yet, therefore I attached two
referees from Imperial College London. If I get a reply from either of my Aachen contacts, I will add a RWTH 
reference as well.

## 3. Publications
I have added two pieces of work - a manuscript of a paper published in our departmental journal and a poster
which I presented at an international URSI conference in 2018.  

## 4. Transcript of Records
Transcript of my records, averaging to 2.1 (upper second) degree. The grading classification corresponds to the
following: 40-50 -> 3, 50-60 -> 2.2, 60-70 -> 2.1, 70+ -> 1.
